# Tic-Tac-Toe (Python) — with simple AI (Minimax)

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe implementation in Python with an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm.  

## Demo
- Play human vs AI.
- The AI uses Minimax to pick optimal moves (it never loses — it will either win or draw against a perfect player).

## Features
- 3×3 Tic-Tac-Toe board (console).
- AI implements Minimax with depth-aware scoring to prefer faster wins and slower losses.
- Clean, modular code.

## Installation
 ```bash
 https://github.com/fooaad/tic-tac-toe.git
 cd tic-tac-toe
 python tic-tac-toe.py
